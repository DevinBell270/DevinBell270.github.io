Hey, I'm Devin Bell.

I'm based in south-central Kentucky.

When I'm not at the computer, you'll probably find me doing one of a few things: either in the gym working on Olympic Weightlifting or out on the water fishing.

## Where to find me

You won't catch me on Facebook or Instagram, but you can definitely connect with me in these places:

- Email: [devin.bell@wku.edu](mailto:devin.bell@wku.edu)
- GitHub: [DevinBell270](https://github.com/DevinBell270)
- Disney YouTube: [Bells in Disney](https://www.youtube.com/@bellsindisney)
