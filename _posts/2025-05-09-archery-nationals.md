On May, 9th, Lacey, Ava, and I all took off for Louisville to go to the National Archery in the Schools Program (NASP®) National competition.

It was a huge event, held at the Kentucky Exposition Center. Ava was competing in the bullseye competition, which meant she was shooting at targets from both 10 meters and 15 meters away.

She did awesome and shot a 200! What was really cool was that shot this using the new bow we bought her at the state championships.

Her grandparents came up to watch and cheer her on.
