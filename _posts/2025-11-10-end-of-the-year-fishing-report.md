description: A recap of the 2025 fishing season, exploring new waterways, mastering soft plastics, and sharing the sport with friends.

As fall is wrapping up and fishing is slowing down, I'd like to take a second to recap the last year (2025) of fishing.

This year I spent a lot of time exploring new waterways. I purchased my Tennessee license this year and have fished all around Nashville, Goodlettsville, and Murfreesboro. Along with that, I've explored new areas back in Kentucky along Drakes Creek in Warren and Allen counties and a few streams up in Louisville.

I also focused a lot on new fishing techniques. The previous year I spent most of my time fishing with hard baits, but this year I really wanted to dial in on using plastics. I've really come to love wacky-rigged worms (Strike King Shimmy Sticks) and Fluke-style soft jerkbaits. This has led to some of the biggest fish I've ever caught and, honestly, just more consistent days of catching fish.

Also this year, I introduced some of the homies to fishing, and that's been even more rewarding than catching fish myself.
