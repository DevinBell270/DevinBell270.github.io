description: A story about picking out this year's Christmas tree at Creekside Garden & Nursery in Smiths Grove.

It's that time of the year again. Christmas trees are available, so we drove out to Smiths Grove to visit Creekside Garden & Nursery. Creekside has their Christmas trees earlier than anyone else in our area. Since we take our tree down before we leave for Disney during Christmas week, we like to have it up as early as possible.

This year, we decided to go with a larger 7ft tree and picked the widest one they had in that range. I love how full the tree looks, we can stack so many ornaments on it. Next year, we will have to get more lights to cover such a big tree, but I love the way it turned out.
